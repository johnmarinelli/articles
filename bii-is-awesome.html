<h1>Bii is an awesome dependency manager for C++.</h1>
<h2>As a C++ developer, I know how annoying it is to hunt down libraries, install them, link them, and pray that you're given a good .obj file.  Bii solves this problem, and creates a nice environment for C++ to update and share code.  On top of that, Bii has a great community and is stupid-simple.</h2>

<p>I just managed to build to build & show an SDL2 Hello World app in just a few minutes with Bii - something that could easily have taken 20-30 minutes (or an hour, if you're like me).  The beautiful thing about it is that it's very intuitive.  The <code>bii find</code> command is super handy; all you do is <code>#include</code> a block in your .cpp file, and bii will find the corresponding block for you.</p>

<p>
Here's an example of building an SDL2 Hello World app with bii (assuming you've got it installed already).  This was built on Linux Mint 17 Qiana, using Bii 1.11.</p>

<p>
First, <code>bii init SDL2</code> in a directory.  This will create a new folder, SDL2, with "blocks", "bii", and "deps" subdirectories.  Now <code>cd</code> into your SDL2 directory, and <code>mkdir -p blocks/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/sdl2</code>.  Write a quick main.cpp file in this directory:

<code><pre>

#include "miguel/sdl2/include/SDL.h"
#include &lt;stdio&gt;

const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 640;
const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480;

int main(int argc, char* args[])
{
    SDL_Window* window = NULL;

    SDL_Surface* screenSurface = NULL;

    if(SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {
        printf("SDL couldn't initialize.");
    }   

    else {
        window = SDL_CreateWindow("SDL Skeleton", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);

        if(NULL == window) {
            printf("Window is null.");
        }

        else {
            screenSurface = SDL_GetWindowSurface(window);

            SDL_FillRect(screenSurface, NULL, SDL_MapRGB(screenSurface->format, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff)); 

            SDL_UpdateWindowSurface(window);

            SDL_Delay(2000);
        }
    }   

    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}

</pre></code>

Now, all you have to do is <code>bii find</code>, and bii will locate the SDL2 block for you.  Next, do <code>bii cpp:build</code>, and you can see SDL being compiled & linked against your program.  The executable will be in SDL2/bin.

to be honest, all I wanted out of this was the shirt, and that's what I was gunning for originally.  However, using it made me really excited - imagine simply typing in #include "path/to/opengl" and being able to use OpenGL without the scary linker and compiler errors!<br/>This is truly the future of C++ dev, and frankly, America.  consider me enthused.
