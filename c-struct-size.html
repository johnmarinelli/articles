<h2>Struct sizes in C</h2>

<p>Here's an interesting little tidbit about structs and C: the size of the struct depends the order in which you declare your struct's member variables.  Let's look at an example:</p>

<code><pre>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct X {
    int a;
    char b;
    int c;
};

int main(void)
{
    /* note: %zu was added in C99 as a format specifier for size_t type */
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(int)); // 4
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(char)); // 1
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(struct X)); // 12

    return 0;
}

</pre></code>

<p>This code makes sense - the size of two ints is 8, one char is 9, and the compiler pads our data to a multiple of 4 for efficiency.  Fun fact: in gcc, you can use -fpack-struct to get <code>sizeof(struct X)</code> to return 9.  However, you probably don't want to do this unless you know *exactly* what you're doing, because although you save memory this way, the code will take much longer to execute.  Moving on!</p>

<p>Let's add another <code>char</code> to our struct.  Where shall we put it?  Try appending it to the end:</p>
<code><pre>
struct X {
    int a;
    char b;
    int c;
    char d;
};
</pre></code>

<p>Compile this and run.  The size of <code>struct X</code> should now return 16.  Why?  Well, it turns out that the compiler will see the first three elements as being of size 12 already, and the extra <code>char d</code> adds 1, giving us 13, and 13 becomes 16.  Let's try putting <code>char d</code> immediately after <code>char b</code>:</p>

<code><pre>
struct X {
    int a;
    char b;
    char d;
    int c;
};
</pre></code>

<p>Compile and run.  Whoa!  <code>sizeof(struct X)</code> now returns 12!  The compiler now sees the first three elements as being of size 8, and adds the int to return 12.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: place your data in memory-size order in your C structs!  Other compilers do this automatically, but C/C++ don't.</p>
