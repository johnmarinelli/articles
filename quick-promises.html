<h1>Quick & trivial promise implementation using jQuery</h1>
<h2>Promises are a synchronous solution to an asynchronous problem</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you'll have procedurally written code in an async environment (especially when you're just starting out with node.js or jQuery).  For example: </p>
<code><pre>
var myParagraph = $('<p id="my-paragraph">');
function myFunction() {
  /* let's say that you make an asynchronous AJAX call, whereupon its completion we append a DOM element to the body with an id of 'my-paragraph' */
  $.ajax({
    url: 'some_script.php'
  })

  /* 
  * then you write some code in a standard procedural style and forget about that new paragraph for a while...
  */

  /* now we want to do something with the paragraph that we had appended earlier - but wait! */
  $("p#my-paragraph").html('HEY THERE');

  /* 
  *  this (probably) won't do anything - the $.ajax function is asynchronous, so if it'll start and end on its own time.  
  *  what if the rest of the script body gets executed before the $.ajax call is done? 
  *  since we didn't append p#my-paragraph until the $.ajax call is finished, this line will fail.  
  *  what's more is that it will fail silently, because jQuery will eat up the error.
  */
}
</pre></code>

<p>Now, with promises, we can amend this:</p>
<code><pre>
function myFunction(){    
    var promise = $.ajax({
      url: 'some_script.php'
    });
    
    /* since we've wrapped this in .always(), this code will only get called once the AJAX call has returned (whether it failed or not) */
    promise.always(function() {
      $("p#my-paragraph").html("HEY THERE");
    });
    
    /* jQuery's then() function can take two separate functions for success & failure, whereas always() will be called regardless */
    promise.then(function(){
      console.log("this will be executed first on success...");
    }, function() {
      console.log("this will be executed first on failure...");
    }).then(function() {
      console.log("and this, second on success");
    }, function() {
      console.log("and this, second on failure");
    });
}
</pre></code>

<p>
The difference between promises and callbacks is that this:
<code><pre>
promise.then(firstAsyncFunction)
       .then(secondAsynFunction);
</pre></code>
is much prettier than this:
<code><pre>
firstAsyncFunction(function() {
  return secondAsyncFunction(function() {
    lastFunction();
  });
});
</pre></code>
