<h2>Just a friendly reminder to declare your destructors virtual in non-final classes in C++</h2>
<p>There was a thread on HackerNews sharing someones C++ algorithms & data structures repository.  In the comments, someone pointed out that the abstract structure <code>Tree</code> didn't have a virtual destructor.  This is a quick writeup showing how that can lead to fun memory leaks.</p>
<p>Let's work with this code:</p>

<code><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

class Base
{
public:

    Base()
    {
        printf("Base Ctor\n");
    }

    ~Base()
    {
        printf("Base Dtor\n");
    }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:

    Derived() : Base()
    {
        printf("Derived Ctor\n");
    }

    ~Derived()
    {
        printf("Derived Dtor\n");
    }
};

int main(int argc, char* args[])
{
    Base* b = new Derived;
    delete b;
    return 0;
}
</pre></code>

<p>Compiling & running the code should give you this:</p>
<code><pre>
Base Ctor
Derived Ctor
Base Dtor
</pre></code>

<p>See what happens?  The Derived destructor gets cut off, and the Derived class leaks memory.</p>
<p>Stay safe this holiday season, and always declare your non-final classes' destructors virtual, kids.</p>
